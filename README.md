# VoiceGenderRecognition
Normal human speech frequency varies between 50 and 300 Hz. Most men are between 85 and 180 Hz and most women are between 165 and 255 Hz. Based on this difference,
we can recognize the gender of a voice after drawing the power spectrum of the voice signal.

This project is a part of the final bounes project for the Signals and Systems course at The Amirkabit 
University of Technology. The full description of the project in Persian is available in the [description file](/description.pdf).
